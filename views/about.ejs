        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          SthanaMitra is a student-first accommodation platform built to make finding a safe,
          comfortable and affordable place to stay as easy as booking a movie ticket.
          From PGs and hostels to fully furnished flats, we connect students with verified
          properties in major education hubs across India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word <strong>“SthanaMitra”</strong> comes from two ideas:
          <strong>Sthana</strong> (place) and <strong>Mitra</strong> (friend). We aim to be that
          reliable friend who understands your budget, your college timings, your need for
          Wi-Fi before anything else, and helps you find the right place to call “home”.

          In the coming phases, we aim to introduce features like roommate matching,
          digital agreements, online rent reminders and exclusive student community
          benefits that make life simpler, safer and more connected for every learner.
